GitHub Swipe - React Native application.

#Objective#

GitHub Swipe wants to tackle the challenge of dealing with **Open Source** projects by making it easier for you to explore popular **Open Source** projects on GitHub, keep in touch with others on the same wavelength, and discover simple ways to start your contributions back to the community.

Initially, GitHub Swipe will be a **React Native iOS application** - plans follow for a web interface, so stay tuned.

#Roadmap#

Right now, we're working on this native application along with a backend to support our 'client' efforts. Our backend is taking shape beautifully as a **Ruby on Rails** + **PostgreSQL** stack. We aim to deliver a *sever-side rendered* experience for the web client.

While we're working on making Open Source a little easier to hop into - we're considering this an Open Source effort as well. Plans are being made to add contribution guides and additional documentation - but at the moment, we're tackling wiring up the basics and utilizing some of the most exciting emerging technologies like: **React Native, Redux, Immutable.js**

#Style Guide#

Currently, we are aiming to follow the principles (and reasonable) approach by AirBnb as far as code style goes.

#Contribute#

Further documentation will follow - keep your eyes peeled!
